The simplest way to calculate the value of AMC Theater points is to divide the dollar value of the reward by the number of points required to redeem it.

## Example

For example, it takes 5,000 points to get a $5 reward, so AMC Theater points are worth 0.1 cents each.

## Points earned per dollar

How much do you have to spend to earn those $5,000 points?

Start by figuring out how many points you earn per dollar?

## Example

Their website says you earn 20 points for each dollar spent.
Set $1/20 = x/5000 points
20x = $5,000
x = $5000/20
x = $250

You have to spend $250 to earn 5000 points ($5).

## Return

$5/$250 = 0.02
So AMC Theaters offers a 2% return.
